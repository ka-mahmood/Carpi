05/07 To do:
- Create ability to add exercises to exercise routine in-app (link name, YouTube video, description, sets, reps) - add disclaimer not to add exercises unless approved
- Create button to start routine - allow for selection of all routines, individual routines (via selection card), and output error if no routines -> needs local data storage
- Routine page: show timer of progress (overall as well as resting periods/time per exercise period), count reps (use mediapipe/emgs to track this) 
- Improve login page (maybe implement forms and Firebase to store data) - for now, implement local data storage (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66081455/flutter-how-to-save-data-locally)
